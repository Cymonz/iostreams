# Contributing

Welcome to IOStreams, great to have you on-board. :tada:

To get you started here are some pointers. 

## Open Source

#### Early Adopters

Great to have you onboard, looking forward to your help and feedback.

#### Late Adopters

IOStreams is open source code, the author and contributors do this work when we have the "free time" to do so.

We are not here to write code for some random edge case that you may have at your paid job. 
That is the point of Pull Requests where you can contribute your own enhancements.

## Documentation

Documentation updates are welcome and appreciated by all users of IOStreams.

#### Small changes

For a quick and fairly simple documentation fix the changes can be made entirely online in github.
 
1. Fork the repository in github.
2. Look for the markdown file that matches the documentation page to be updated under the `docs` subdirectory.
3. Click Edit.
4. Make the change and select preview to see what the changes would look like.
5. Save the change with a commit message.
6. Submit a Pull Request back to the IOStreams repository. 

#### Complete Setup

To make multiple changes to the documentation, add new pages or just to have a real preview of what the
documentation would look like locally after any changes.

1. Fork the repository in github.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Change into the documentation directory.

       cd iostreams/docs
       
4. Install required gems

       bundle update
       
5. Start the Jekyll server

       jekyll s

6. Open a browser to: http://127.0.0.1:4000

7. Navigate around and find the page to edit. The url usually lines up with the markdown file that
   contains the corresponding text.
   
8. Edit the files ending in `.md` and refresh the page in the web browser to see the change.

9. Once change are complete commit the changes.

10. Push the changes to your forked repository.

11. Submit a Pull Request back to the IOStreams repository. 

## Code Changes

Since changes cannot be made directly to the IOStreams repository, fork it to your own account on Github. 

1. Fork the repository in github.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Change into the IOStreams directory.

       cd iostreams
       
4. Install required gems

       bundle update
       
5. Run tests

       bundle exec rake

6. When making a bug fix it is recommended to update the test first, ensure the test fails, and only then
   make the codefix.

7. Once the tests pass and all code changes are complete, commit the changes.
   
8. Push changes to your forked repository.

9. Submit a Pull Request back to the IOStreams repository. 

## Philosopy

IOStreams can be used to work against a single stream. it's real capability becomes apparent when chaining together
multiple streams to process data, without loading entire files into memory.

#### Linux Pipes

Linux has built-in support for streaming using the `|` (pipe operator) to send the output from one process to another. 

Example: count the number of lines in a compressed file: 

    gunzip -c hello.csv.gz | wc -l

The file `hello.csv.gz` is uncompressed and returned to standard output, which in turn is piped into the standard
input for `wc -l`, which counts the number of lines in the uncompressed data.

As each block of data is returned from `gunzip` it is immediately passed into `wc` so that it 
can start counting lines of uncompressed data, without waiting until the entire file is decompressed. 
The uncompressed contents of the file are not written to disk before passing to `wc -l` and the file is not loaded
into memory before passing to `wc -l`.

In this way extremely large files can be processed with very little memory being used.

#### Push Model

In the Linux pipes example above this would be considered a "push model" where each task in the list pushes
its output to the input of the next task.

A major challenge or disadvantage with the push model is that buffering would need to occur between tasks since 
each task could complete at very different speeds. To prevent large memory usage the standard output from a previous
task would have to be blocked to try and make it slow down.

#### Pull Model

Another approach with multiple tasks that need to process a single stream, is to move to a "pull model" where the
task at the end of the list pulls a block from a previous task when it is ready to process it.

#### IOStreams

IOStreams uses the pull model when reading data, where each stream performs a read against the previous stream 
when it is ready for more data.

When writing to an output stream, IOStreams uses the push model, where each block of data that is ready to be written
is pushed to the task/stream in the list. The write push only returns once it has traversed all the way down to
the final task / stream in the list, this avoids complex buffering issues between each task / stream in the list.

Example: Implementing in Ruby: `gunzip -c hello.csv.gz | wc -l`

~~~ruby
  line_count = 0
  IOStreams::Gzip::Reader.open("hello.csv.gz") do |input|
    IOStreams::Line::Reader.open(input) do |lines|
      lines.each { line_count += 1}
    end
  end
  puts "hello.csv.gz contains #{line_count} lines"
~~~

Since IOStreams can autodetect file types based on the file extension, `IOStreams.reader` can figure which stream
to start with:
~~~ruby
  line_count = 0
  IOStreams.path("hello.csv.gz").reader do |input|
    IOStreams::Line::Reader.open(input) do |lines|
      lines.each { line_count += 1}
    end
  end
  puts "hello.csv.gz contains #{line_count} lines"
~~~

Since we know we want a line reader, it can be simplified using `#reader(:line)`:
~~~ruby
  line_count = 0
  IOStreams.path("hello.csv.gz").reader(:line) do |lines|
    lines.each { line_count += 1}
  end
  puts "hello.csv.gz contains #{line_count} lines"
~~~

It can be simplified even further using `#each`:
~~~ruby
  line_count = 0
  IOStreams.path("hello.csv.gz").each { line_count += 1}
  puts "hello.csv.gz contains #{line_count} lines"
~~~

The benefit in all of the above cases is that the file can be any arbitrary size and only one block of the file
is held in memory at any time.

#### Chaining

In the above example only 2 streams were used. Streams can be nested as deep as necessary to process data.

Example, search for all occurrences of the word apple, cleansing the input data stream of non printable characters 
and converting to valid US ASCII.

~~~ruby
  apple_count = 0
  IOStreams::Gzip::Reader.open("hello.csv.gz") do |input|
    IOStreams::Encode::Reader.open(input, 
                                   encoding:       "US-ASCII", 
                                   encode_replace: "", 
                                   encode_cleaner: :printable) do |cleansed|
      IOStreams::Line::Reader.open(cleansed) do |lines|
        lines.each { |line| apple_count += line.scan("apple").count}
      end
  end
  puts "Found the word 'apple' #{apple_count} times in hello.csv.gz"
~~~

Let IOStreams perform the above stream chaining automatically under the covers:

~~~ruby
  apple_count = 0
  IOStreams.path("hello.csv.gz").
    option(:encode, encoding: "US-ASCII", replace: "", cleaner: :printable).
    each do |line|
      apple_count += line.scan("apple").count
    end

  puts "Found the word 'apple' #{apple_count} times in hello.csv.gz"
~~~

## Architecture

Every Reader or Writer is invoked by calling its `.open` method and passing the block
that must be invoked for the duration of that stream.

The above block is passed the stream that needs to be encoded/decoded using that
Reader or Writer every time the `#read` or `#write` method is called on it.

~~~ruby
IOStreams::Xlsx::Reader.open('a.xlsx') do |stream|
  IOStreams::Record::Reader.open(stream, format: :array) do |record_stream|
    record_stream.each { |record| ap record }
  end
end
~~~

### Readers

Each reader stream must implement: `#read`

### Writer

Each writer stream must implement: `#write`

### Optional methods

The following methods on the stream are useful for both Readers and Writers

### close

Close the stream, and cleanup any buffers, etc.

### closed?

Has the stream already been closed? Useful, when child streams have already closed the stream
so that `#close` is not called more than once on a stream.
